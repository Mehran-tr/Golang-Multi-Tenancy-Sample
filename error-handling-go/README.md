# Idiomatic Error Handling and Panic Recovery in Go

This project demonstrates idiomatic error handling, custom error types, and the use of panic and recover mechanisms in Go. The program handles errors explicitly, shows how to create and use custom error types, and provides an example of recovering from panics.

## Key Features
- **Explicit Error Handling**: Functions return errors explicitly, avoiding exceptions.
- **Custom Error Types**: Provides more detailed context for error conditions.
- **Panic and Recover**: Demonstrates how to use panic for critical errors and recover to prevent crashes.

## Sample Output:

    Error: error with file test.txt: file does not exist
    Attempting division by zero...
    Recovered from panic: cannot divide by zero

## How to Run

```bash
go run main.go
```
